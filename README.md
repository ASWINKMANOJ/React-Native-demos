# React Native Demos

I'm currently immersed in learning React Native, where I'm exploring the robust capabilities of React Native Reanimated and React Native Gesture Handler. My primary focus revolves around experimenting with diverse gestures and delving into the realm of color interpolation techniques. Through the utilization of these libraries, my objective is to craft engaging and interactive user experiences in my applications. Additionally, I'm delving into the realm of navigation using react-navigation/native, experimenting with various navigation styles such as bottom tabs, top bar, and drawer. Furthermore, I have been diligently working on developing a password generator app, which is nearly complete and ready for deployment.
